I am an electrical engineering student at the University of Texas at Arlington. Interests of mine include engineering, physics, and computers.

I owe a lot to the inspirational faculty within the physics and engineering departments at UTA, specifically Dr. Asaadi and Dr. Farbin. Through an undergraduate research project, I was introduced to research by Dr. Farbin, involving the applications of neural networks and machine learning to big data sets created in particle physics experiments like those at CERN. This involved a knowledge of Linux, programming languages like Python and C, and the ability to learn computational analysis and model assembly techniques quickly. Currently, under the mentorship of Dr. Asaadi, I am conducting undergraduate research in neutrino physics, specifically detector technologies for neutrinoless double beta decay. This has involved building a physical prototype detector, teaching electrical engineering concepts firsthand for photodiodes, operational amplifier circuits, and data readout.
