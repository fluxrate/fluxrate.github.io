I am an electrical engineering student at the University of Texas at Arlington. Interests of mine include engineering, physics, and computers.

I owe a lot to the inspirational faculty within the physics and engineering departments at UTA, specifically Dr. Asaadi and Dr. Farbin. Through an undergraduate research project, I was introduced to research by Dr. Farbin, involving the applications of neural networks and machine learning to big data sets created in particle physics experiments like those at CERN. Under the mentorship of Dr. Asaadi, I built a novel prototype detector used in neutrinoless double beta decay research. 

Currently, I am attempting to get funding through the engineering department at UTA for a demo plasma physics research experiment.
